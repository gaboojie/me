# My Personal Website
This is a repository of my personal website.
I am using it to help build my web development
ability and serve as a portfolio of my hobbies.

This repository will include static apps that 
serve small but interesting purposes. Furthermore,
it will provide evidence for some of the projects
that I have worked on in various realms of CS
study. 

If you have any questions or tips, please reach out to me 
at
