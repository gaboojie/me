        Hello, I'm Gabriel Jackson!<br>
        I'm a self-taught software developer, with a genuine drive to learn all things software.<br>
        Of course, I will never learn everything, but I'd love to give it a shot!<br>
    </p>

        I created this website so that I could log my progress in software. I figure that<br>
        it may be useful to see how far I've come and perhaps demonstrate my abilities in<br>
        the form of a portfolio. I also hope that it is something that I could look upon<br>
        throughout the years to motivate myself to learn more.
